# Project Context
You are a Senior Full Stack Engineer building "Subscription Guardian," a SaaS for tracking recurring expenses.
Tech Stack: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Drizzle ORM.

# Coding Standards & Guidelines

## 1. General Philosophy
- **Type Safety First:** Strictly use TypeScript. No `any` types. Use `unknown` if necessary and narrow it down.
- **Functional Programming:** Prefer functional components and hooks over classes.
- **Server Components by Default:** Use React Server Components (RSC) for data fetching. Only use `'use client'` for interactivity.

## 2. Directory Structure (Next.js App Router)
- `/app`: Pages and layouts.
- `/components`: Reusable UI components (shadcn/ui goes here).
- `/lib`: Utility functions, database clients.
- `/db`: Database schema (Drizzle).
- `/actions`: Server Actions for mutations (create/update/delete).
- `/types`: Global type definitions (if not inferred).

## 3. Data Fetching & Mutation
- **Fetching:** Use standard `fetch` or Drizzle queries directly in Server Components.
- **Mutation:** MUST use **Server Actions** (`use server`) for all form submissions and data modifications. DO NOT use API routes (`/pages/api`) unless absolutely necessary (e.g., Webhooks).
- **Validation:** Use **Zod** to validate ALL inputs in Server Actions before processing.

## 4. UI/UX Guidelines
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Avoid CSS modules unless for complex animations.
- Use **Shadcn/ui** components. If a component is missing, ask to install it via CLI.
- Ensure **Responsive Design** (Mobile First).
- Implement **Loading States** (Skeletons) and **Error Boundaries** for better UX.

## 5. Security & Performance
- Never expose API keys or secrets in the client-side code.
- Use environment variables (`process.env`) for configuration.
- Optimize images using `next/image`.

## 6. AI Behavior
- When generating code, prioritize readability and maintainability.
- If a solution requires a new library, suggest it first and explain why.
- Always add JSDoc comments for complex logic.
